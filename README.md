# Would You Rather? Project

===============================

- This is a "Would You Rather?" game project built using `React` and `Redux`. In this game, users are asked to answer "Would You Rather?" questions, with each question consisting of two options.

- Users can also create their own questions and see how other users have voted. Each user can only vote once per question, and the user's answers are tracked on a leaderboard.

- This project was created as part of the `Udacity React Nanodegree program`.

## Usage

- When you first open the app, you'll see a login screen. You can select a user from the dropdown menu and click "Log In" to enter the app.

- Once you're logged in, you'll see the Home page, which shows a list of questions that you can answer. You can select a question to see the two options, and choose the one you prefer. Once you've answered a question, it will be marked as "answered" on the Home page.

- You can also create your own questions by clicking the "New Question" link in the navigation bar. On the New Question page, enter the two options and click "Submit" to create the question.

- Finally, you can view the leaderboard by clicking the "Leaderboard" link in the navigation bar. The leaderboard shows the user's name, avatar, and total score (number of questions answered and created).
